# deadprecisioncheck.sh — A5 internal-linkage dead-code gate.
#
# T13/fix1 (2026-09-20): --dead-code used to stamp confidence="high" as a hardcoded literal on every
# finding — a claim the code did not support (no per-finding evidence of resolver ambiguity, dynamic
# dispatch or reflection risk backed it). Removed rather than faked: the root no longer carries a
# confidence= attribute at all, and evidence= alone states the (disclosed, name-based) rule every row
# met. This gate used to assert confidence="high" was present; it now asserts it is ABSENT.
